Hello there!

This is my first attempt using reactive Shiny programming in R. To run this app, open an Rstudio session, and write the following in the console:

runGitHub(“CANSIM-Shiny-App”, “Chrisss93”)

You may need to install the shinyIncubator package via:

 devtools::install_github("shiny-incubator", "rstudio")

However, if I’ve done my job correctly, it should be installed automatically.

Enjoy!

chris.
